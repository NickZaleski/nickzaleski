const profile = `Project Manager with 5+ years of experience leading medium to large-scale implementation projects in fast-paced, multinational environments. Strong track record delivering projects on time, within scope and budget while managing multiple project streams simultaneously. Experience with both greenfield and brownfield initiatives — from building platforms from scratch to optimizing existing systems. Proficient with project management tools (JIRA, Notion) and comfortable working within Scrum and Agile frameworks. Skilled at stakeholder management across all levels — from C-level executives to junior team members — with a servant leadership approach. Experience with vendor management and third-party coordination. Based in Warsaw, EU citizen, ready to start immediately.`;

const motivation = `Clarity is the kind of company where project management isn't just about tracking tasks — it's about delivering real value to clients through disciplined execution and continuous improvement. That's exactly how I approach PM work. I've spent years ensuring projects stay on track in relation to time, scope, and budget while juggling multiple streams and stakeholders. I thrive as a liaison between business, technical teams, and clients — keeping everyone on the same page and moving forward. What draws me to Clarity is the focus on methodology and SOPs that actually bring value, not just process for process's sake. I bring 5+ years of hands-on project leadership, experience with Scrum/Agile frameworks, vendor management, and the kind of amicable personality that builds trust at every level. I'm excited to contribute to your Project Management Unit and internal improvement initiatives.`;

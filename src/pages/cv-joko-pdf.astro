const profile = `Product Manager with 5+ years of experience shipping consumer-facing and B2B products end-to-end — from discovery and user research through delivery, launch, and adoption. I've built mobile-ready apps, analytics tools, and AI-powered platforms from scratch in fast-paced, remote-first environments. Deeply curious and hands-on with AI tools — I use Cursor, GPT, and AI-driven workflows daily both in my PM work and in side projects I build and ship myself. Strong analytical skills with data-driven decision-making at every step. Entrepreneurial mindset — I thrive where product culture is still being defined and processes are being built alongside the product. EU citizen, ready to work remotely or relocate to Barcelona. Available for B2B or direct hire.`;

const motivation = `Joko is building something I care about as a user — smarter shopping that actually saves money and time. The AI-powered shopping assistant is especially exciting: it's the kind of product where deep technical innovation meets real consumer value, and that intersection is where I do my best work. I'm drawn to Joko's stage — profitable in core market, scaling globally, still early enough that product culture and team processes are being shaped. That's exactly the environment where I contribute most: I don't just execute a roadmap, I help define how product gets done. I bring 5+ years of end-to-end product ownership, hands-on AI fluency, consumer product experience, and an entrepreneurial mindset. I've lived in three countries, I speak four languages, and as an EU citizen I'm ready to join from Barcelona or work remotely — whichever serves the team best.`;
